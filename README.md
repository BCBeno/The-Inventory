# The Inventory 📦  

## ⚡ Overview  

**The Inventory** is a **Java-based microservice** for managing inventory in an **e-commerce or warehouse system**. It keeps track of **products, stock levels, warehouses, suppliers, and inventory movements** (e.g., stock-in, stock-out, transfers). The system ensures **accurate stock tracking** and enables **real-time inventory updates** through a REST API.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Java 21**  
- **Spring Boot** – Backend framework for building RESTful APIs  
- **Hibernate (JPA)** – ORM for database interactions  
- **Spring Data JPA** – Simplified database operations  
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database for storing inventory data  
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** – API documentation and testing  
- **Lombok** – Reducing boilerplate code  
- **Spring Validation** – Request validation and error handling  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Product & Stock Management** – Track product details and stock levels.  
✅ **Warehouse & Supplier Management** – Manage warehouse locations and suppliers.  
✅ **Inventory Movements** – Support stock-in, stock-out, and transfers.  
✅ **REST API** – Expose CRUD operations for seamless integration.  
✅ **API Documentation** – Integrated with **Swagger/OpenAPI**.  
✅ **Database & ORM Support** – Built with **Hibernate & JPA** for efficient data management.  
✅ **Error Handling & Validation** – Implement robust error messages and request validation.  

## 🌟 Learning Outcomes  
- **Backend development with Java & Spring Boot**  
- **RESTful API design and CRUD operations**  
- **Database modeling with Hibernate & JPA**  
- **Error handling & validation best practices**
